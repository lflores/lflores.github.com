# gravity-bubbles examples

If you would like to contribute an example, fork the repo and create a new folder. 

We're currently naming after our data file but feel free to use whatever makes sense for your demo.  

The css and js folder within examples are common to all the examples. If you need static files specific to your projects, simple create new folders within in your demo folder.
